--	ROOT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--	Returns a tuple that consists of the All members from each attribute hierarchy within 
--	the current scope in a cube, dimension, or tuple.

--	If neither a dimension name nor a tuple expression is specified, the Root function returns a tuple that contains
--	the All member (or the default member if the All member does not exist) from each attribute hierarchy in the cube. 
--	The order of members in the tuple is based on the sequence in which the attribute hierarchies are defined within the cube.

--	If a dimension name is specified, the Root function returns a tuple that contains 
--	the All member (or the default member if the All member does not exist) from each attribute hierarchy in the specified dimension 
--	based on the context of the current member. 
--	The order of members in the tuple is based on the sequence in which the attribute hierarchies are defined within the dimension.
