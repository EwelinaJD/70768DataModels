--	Tuple
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--	A tuple uniquely identifies a slice of data from a cube. 
--	The tuple is formed by a combination of dimension members, as long as there are no two or more members 
--	that belong to the same hierarchy.

--	When defining a tuple in an MDX query or expression, you do not need to explicitly include the attribute 
--	member from every attribute hierarchy. 

--	If a member from an attribute hierarchy is not explicitly included in a query or an expression, 
--	the default member for that attribute hierarchy is the attribute member implicitly included in the tuple. 

--	Unless otherwise explicitly defined in a cube, the default member for every attribute hierarchy is the (All) member, 
	--	if an (All) member exists. 
--	If an (All) member does not exist within an attribute hierarchy, the default member is a member 
	--	of the attribute hierarchy's top level. 
	
--	The default measure is the first measure specified in the cube, unless a default measure is explicitly defined.
